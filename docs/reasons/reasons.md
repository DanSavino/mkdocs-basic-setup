# Why an Analytics Team Should Use MkDocs
MkDocs is a static site generator that can be used to create documentation for software projects and other information. There are several reasons why an analytics team might benefit from using MkDocs:

- **Easy collaboration**:  MkDocs allows for easy collaboration on documentation. Team members can write and edit documentation in markdown, which is simple to read and write. This makes it easy for team members to understand and contribute to the documentation.

- **Organization**: With MkDocs, documentation can be organized into sections and sub-sections, making it easy to find the information you need. Additionally, MkDocs includes a built-in search feature, which allows users to quickly find the information they need.

- **Version control**: MkDocs documentation can be version controlled with Git. This allows team members to easily see changes made to the documentation and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

- **Previewing documentation**: MkDocs includes a built-in web server that allows team members to preview the documentation as they work on it. This makes it easy to see how the documentation will look before it is published.

- **Easy to use**: MkDocs is easy to use and requires minimal setup. This allows team members to start creating documentation quickly, without needing to spend a lot of time on setup and configuration.

- **Standardized documentation**:  MkDocs is used by many applications. For example, FastApi, Starlett, MkDocs itself and its third-party extensions and plugins use the tool to create their documentation.

Overall, MkDocs is a powerful tool that can help an analytics team to more easily create and maintain accurate, up-to-date documentation for their projects. It makes it easy to collaborate and organize documentation and also allows for easy previewing and version control.
